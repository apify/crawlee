# Contributing

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Crawlee Project Pre-requisites

For Crawlee project contributions and changes to the codebase will require some pre-requisites to ensure the project is set up properly. These are the most important dependancies you'll need to set up the project, but here are other dev dependancies you might want to take a look at [package.json](./package.json) file.

- node.js version 22.17.0

- yarn version 4.8.1


## Crawlee Installation and Building

This project now uses yarn v4 to manage dependencies. You will need to install it, the easiest way is by using `corepack`:

```shell
corepack enable
```

After enabling corepack, you will need to be in the project root directory and install the dependencies before building.

```shell
yarn install
```

After installing the dependencies, you can build the Crawlee project.

```shell
yarn build
```

### Module not found





## Submission guidelines

### Submitting an issue

Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists, and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

Please provide steps to reproduce if you found a bug or ideally fork the repository and add a failing test that demonstrates what is wrong. This will help us understand and fix the issue faster.

### Submitting a pull request

Before you submit your pull request, consider the following guidelines:

- Search [GitHub](https://github.com/apify/crawlee/pulls) for an open or closed PR that relates to your submission. You don't want to duplicate effort.

- Fork the project and install NPM dependencies.

- Run tests before you start working, to be sure they all pass and your setup is working correctly:

    ```sh
    yarn test
    ```

- Be sure to **include appropriate test cases**. Tests help make it clear what the PR is fixing and also make sure the changes won't break over time.
- Commit your changes using a descriptive commit message that follows defined [commit message conventions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit#heading=h.uyo6cb12dt6w). Adherence to these conventions is necessary because release notes are automatically generated from these messages.
- Push the code to your forked repository and create a pull request on GitHub.
- If somebody from project contributors suggests changes:
    - Make the required updates.
    - Re-run all test suites to ensure tests are still passing.
    - Commit them and push. Don't rebase after you get a review, so it is clear what changes you did in the last commit. The PR will be squash merged, so its history is irrelevant.

That's it! Thank you for your contribution!

### macOS

Our proxy tests use different loopback addresses to ensure traffic correctness.
In contrary to Windows and Linux, macOS comes with only one loopback address - `127.0.0.1`.
Therefore it is necessary to run the following once per system startup:

```
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2 up
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.3 up
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.4 up
```

### Arch linux

Arch linux is [not officially supported](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/8100) by Playwright, which causes problems in tests. You need to install dependencies manually:

```
yay -S libffi7 icu66 libwebp052 flite-unpatched
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libpcre.so /usr/lib/libpcre.so.3
```

## Testing in Crawlee with vitest

There are a few small differences between how testing in jest and vitest works. Mostly, they relate to what to do, and not do anymore.

### Configuration file for tests created in the package they are for

You will need to use this tsconfig.json in the `test` folder in the package (say, if you were adding a test to `packages/core` and there wasn't a `tsconfig.json` file already there)

```json
{
    "extends": "../../../tsconfig.json",
    "include": ["**/*", "../../**/*"],
    "compilerOptions": {
        "types": ["vitest/globals"]
    }
}
```

### Mocking modules

Mocks are pretty much the same when it comes to jest vs vitest. One crucial difference is that you no longer need to unmock modules in an afterAll block, as they are mocked per test file.

#### Previous

```ts
jest.mock('node:os', () => {
    const original: typeof import('node:os') = jest.requireActual('node:os');
    return {
        ...original,
        platform: () => 'darwin',
        freemem: jest.fn(),
    };
});

afterAll(() => {
    jest.unmock('node:os');
});
```

#### Now

```ts
vitest.mock('node:os', async (importActual) => {
    const original = await importActual<typeof import('node:os')>();
    return {
        ...original,
        platform: () => 'darwin',
        freemem: jest.fn(),
    };
});
```

### Mocking based on imports

Given the following two samples:

#### 1

```ts
import os from 'node:os';

console.log(os.platform());
```

#### 2

```ts
import { platform } from 'node:os';

console.log(platform());
```

You will need to mock the module based on how you import it in the source code. This means, if you will import the default export, you will need to add a `default` property to the mocked object. Otherwise, you will need to mock the module as is.

So, for example 1:

```ts
vitest.mock('node:os', async (importActual) => {
    const original = await importActual<
        typeof import('node:os') & { default: typeof import('node:os') }
    >();

    const platformMock = () => 'darwin';
    const freememMock = vitest.fn();

    return {
        ...original,
        platform: platformMock,
        freemem: freememMock,
        // Specifically, you'll need to also mock the `default` property of the module, as seen below
        default: {
            ...original.default,
            platform: platformMock,
            freemem: freememMock,
        },
    };
});
```

And for example 2:

```ts
vitest.mock('node:os', async (importActual) => {
    const original = await importActual<typeof import('node:os')>();

    const platformMock = () => 'darwin';
    const freememMock = vitest.fn();

    return {
        ...original,
        platform: platformMock,
        freemem: freememMock,
    };
});
```

### Mocked functions

In previous jest code, we had to cast mocked functions as `jest.MockedFunction`. This is _technically_ still needed, but vitest gives us a utility function that casts it for us: `vitest.mocked()`. It doesn't do anything runtime wise, but it helps with type inference.

```ts
import os from 'node:os';

const mockedPlatform = vitest.mocked(os.platform);
```

### Resetting spies to original implementation

You no longer need to reset spies to their original implementation. This is done automatically for you via vitest's `restoreMocks` option.

With that said, if you create spies in a `beforeAll`/`beforeEach` hook, you might need to call this at the start of your file: `vitest.setConfig({ restoreMocks: false });`, as otherwise your spies will be reset before your tests run.

### Separate spy instances for methods track their own calls

In previous jest code, you could do something like this:

```ts
const spy = jest.spyOn(os, 'platform').mockReturnValueOnce('darwin');

expect(os.platform()).toBe('darwin');
expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

const spy2 = jest.spyOn(os, 'platform').mockReturnValueOnce('linux');

expect(os.platform()).toBe('linux');
expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
```

This is no longer valid in vitest. You will need to re-use the same spy instance.

```ts
const spy = vitest.spyOn(os, 'platform').mockReturnValueOnce('darwin');

expect(os.platform()).toBe('darwin');
expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

spy.mockReturnValueOnce('linux');

expect(os.platform()).toBe('linux');
expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(2);
```

## Changing test settings

In jest, we were able to do the following to adjust timeouts at runtime:

```ts
if (os.platform() === 'win32') {
    jest.setTimeout(100_000);
}
```

In vitest, you need to call the `vitest.setConfig` function instead (and specify what to change):

```ts
if (os.platform() === 'win32') {
    vitest.setConfig({
        testTimeout: 100_000,
    });
}
```

## Hook callbacks

In jest, we were able to call the callback provided in the hooks to signal the hook has executed successfully:

```ts
beforeAll((done) => {
    // Do something
    done();
});
```

In vitest, this is no longer provided, but _can_ be substituted with a promise:

```ts
beforeAll(async () => {
    await new Promise((resolve) => {
        // Do something
        resolve();
    });
});
```

## `const enums`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Certain projects, like `puppeteer` declare `const enum`s in their typings. These are enums that do not actually exist at runtime, but enums that `tsc` (which is what we're currently using to compile Crawlee) can inline the values of
> directly into the compiled code. You should avoid importing `const enums` as `vitest` will not inline them like `tsc` does and will throw an error, unless the enum is also present at runtime (check by importing the module and seeing if it's exported anywhere).

## Testing for class names in stack traces

Some tests may want to check for error stack traces and the presence of class names (a prime example is our tests for logging the stack traces for certain logger levels). In `jest`, you were able to do this:

```ts
expect(/at BasicCrawler\.requestHandler/.test(stackTrace)).toBe(true);
```

In `vitest`, at the time of writing this (2023/10/12), class names get an `_` prepended to them. In order to solve this, just add `_?` to your regular expression test (this will match both with and without the `_`).

```ts
expect(/at _?BasicCrawler\.requestHandler/.test(stackTrace)).toBe(true);
```
