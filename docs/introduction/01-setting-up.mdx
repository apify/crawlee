To run Crawlee on your own computer, you need to meet the following pre-requisites first:

1. Have **Node.js version 16.0** or higher installed.
   - Visit [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) to download or use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm)
2. Have **NPM** installed, or use other package manager of your choice.
   - NPM comes bundled with Node.js, so you should already have it. If not, reinstall Node.js.

If not certain, confirm the prerequisites by running:

```bash
node -v
```

```bash
npm -v
```

## Creating a new project

The fastest and best way to create new projects with Crawlee is to use the [Crawlee CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@crawlee/cli). You can use the `npx` utility to download and run the CLI - it is embedded in the `crawlee` package:

```bash
npx crawlee create my-crawler
```

A prompt will be shown, asking you to choose a template. Crawlee is written in TypeScript so if you're familiar with it, choosing a TypeScript template will give you better code completion and static type checking, but feel free to use JavaScript as well. Functionally they're identical.

Let's choose the first template called **Getting started example**. The command will create a new directory in your current working directory, called **my-crawler**, add a **package.json** to this folder and install all the necessary dependencies. It will also add example source code that you can immediately run.

Let's try that!

```bash
cd my-crawler
npm start
```

You will see log messages in the terminal as Crawlee boots up and starts scraping the Crawlee website.

```log
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Starting the crawl
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Title of https://crawlee.dev/ is 'Crawlee · Build reliable crawlers. Fast. | Crawlee'
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Title of https://crawlee.dev/docs/examples is 'Examples | Crawlee'
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Title of https://crawlee.dev/api/core is '@crawlee/core | API | Crawlee'
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Title of https://crawlee.dev/api/core/changelog is 'Changelog | API | Crawlee'
INFO  PlaywrightCrawler: Title of https://crawlee.dev/docs/quick-start is 'Quick Start | Crawlee'
```

You can always terminate the crawl with a keypress in the terminal:

```text
CTRL+C
```

### Running headful browsers

Browsers controlled by Playwright run headless (without a visible window). You can switch to headful by uncommenting the `headless: false` option in the crawler's constructor. This is useful in the development phase when you want to see what's going on in the browser.


```typescript
// Uncomment this option to see the browser window.
headless: false
```

When you run the example again, after a second a Chromium browser window will open. In the window, you'll see quickly changing pages as the crawler does its job.

:::note

For the sake of this show off, we've slowed down the crawler, but rest assured, it's blazing fast in real world usage.
