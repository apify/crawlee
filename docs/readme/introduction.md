<!-- Mirror this part to src/index.js -->

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/apify.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apify)

Apify SDK simplifies the development of web crawlers, scrapers, data extractors and web automation jobs.
It provides tools to manage and automatically scale a pool of headless browsers,
to maintain queues of URLs to crawl, store crawling results to a local filesystem or into the cloud,
rotate proxies and much more.
The SDK is available as the [`apify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/apify) NPM package.
It can be used either stand-alone in your own applications
or in [actors](https://docs.apify.com/actor)
running on the [Apify Cloud](https://apify.com/).
