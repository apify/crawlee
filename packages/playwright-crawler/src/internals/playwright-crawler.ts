/**
 * Provides a simple framework for parallel crawling of web pages
 * using headless Chromium, Firefox and Webkit browsers with [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright).
 * The URLs to crawl are fed either from a static list of URLs
 * or from a dynamic queue of URLs enabling recursive crawling of websites.
 *
 * Since `Playwright` uses headless browser to download web pages and extract data,
 * it is useful for crawling of websites that require to execute JavaScript.
 * If the target website doesn't need JavaScript, consider using {@apilink CheerioCrawler},
 * which downloads the pages using raw HTTP requests and is about 10x faster.
 *
 * The source URLs are represented using {@apilink Request} objects that are fed from
 * {@apilink RequestList} or {@apilink RequestQueue} instances provided by the {@apilink PlaywrightCrawlerOptions.requestList}
 * or {@apilink PlaywrightCrawlerOptions.requestQueue} constructor options, respectively.
 *
 * If both {@apilink PlaywrightCrawlerOptions.requestList} and {@apilink PlaywrightCrawlerOptions.requestQueue} are used,
 * the instance first processes URLs from the {@apilink RequestList} and automatically enqueues all of them
 * to {@apilink RequestQueue} before it starts their processing. This ensures that a single URL is not crawled multiple times.
 *
 * The crawler finishes when there are no more {@apilink Request} objects to crawl.
 *
 * `PlaywrightCrawler` opens a new Chrome page (i.e. tab) for each {@apilink Request} object to crawl
 * and then calls the function provided by user as the {@apilink PlaywrightCrawlerOptions.requestHandler} option.
 *
 * New pages are only opened when there is enough free CPU and memory available,
 * using the functionality provided by the {@apilink AutoscaledPool} class.
 * All {@apilink AutoscaledPool} configuration options can be passed to the {@apilink PlaywrightCrawlerOptions.autoscaledPoolOptions}
 * parameter of the `PlaywrightCrawler` constructor. For user convenience, the `minConcurrency` and `maxConcurrency`
 * {@apilink AutoscaledPoolOptions} are available directly in the `PlaywrightCrawler` constructor.
 *
 * Note that the pool of Playwright instances is internally managed by the [BrowserPool](https://github.com/apify/browser-pool) class.
 *
 * **Example usage:**
 *
 * ```javascript
 * const crawler = new PlaywrightCrawler({
 *     async requestHandler({ page, request }) {
 *         // This function is called to extract data from a single web page
 *         // 'page' is an instance of Playwright.Page with page.goto(request.url) already called
 *         // 'request' is an instance of Request class with information about the page to load
 *         await Dataset.pushData({
 *             title: await page.title(),
 *             url: request.url,
 *             succeeded: true,
 *         })
 *     },
 *     async failedRequestHandler({ request }) {
 *         // This function is called when the crawling of a request failed too many times
 *         await Dataset.pushData({
 *             url: request.url,
 *             succeeded: false,
 *             errors: request.errorMessages,
 *         })
 *     },
 * });
 *
 * await crawler.run([
 *     'http://www.example.com/page-1',
 *     'http://www.example.com/page-2',
 * ]);
