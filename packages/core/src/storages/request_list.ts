/**
 * Represents a static list of URLs to crawl.
 * The URLs can be provided either in code or parsed from a text file hosted on the web.
 * `RequestList` is used by {@apilink BasicCrawler}, {@apilink CheerioCrawler}, {@apilink PuppeteerCrawler}
 * and {@apilink PlaywrightCrawler} as a source of URLs to crawl.
 *
 * Each URL is represented using an instance of the {@apilink Request} class.
 * The list can only contain unique URLs. More precisely, it can only contain `Request` instances
 * with distinct `uniqueKey` properties. By default, `uniqueKey` is generated from the URL, but it can also be overridden.
 * To add a single URL to the list multiple times, corresponding {@apilink Request} objects will need to have different
 * `uniqueKey` properties. You can use the `keepDuplicateUrls` option to do this for you when initializing the
 * `RequestList` from sources.
 *
 * `RequestList` doesn't have a public constructor, you need to create it with the asynchronous {@apilink RequestList.open} function. After
 * the request list is created, no more URLs can be added to it.
 * Unlike {@apilink RequestQueue}, `RequestList` is static but it can contain even millions of URLs.
 * > Note that `RequestList` can be used together with `RequestQueue` by the same crawler.
 * > In such cases, each request from `RequestList` is enqueued into `RequestQueue` first and then consumed from the latter.
 * > This is necessary to avoid the same URL being processed more than once (from the list first and then possibly from the queue).
 * > In practical terms, such a combination can be useful when there is a large number of initial URLs,
 * > but more URLs would be added dynamically by the crawler.
 *
 * `RequestList` has an internal state where it stores information about which requests were already handled,
 * which are in progress and which were reclaimed. The state may be automatically persisted to the default
 * {@apilink KeyValueStore} by setting the `persistStateKey` option so that if the Node.js process is restarted,
 * the crawling can continue where it left off. The automated persisting is launched upon receiving the `persistState`
 * event that is periodically emitted by {@apilink EventManager}.
 *
 * The internal state is closely tied to the provided sources (URLs). If the sources change on crawler restart, the state will become corrupted and
 * `RequestList` will raise an exception. This typically happens when the sources is a list of URLs downloaded from the web.
 * In such case, use the `persistRequestsKey` option in conjunction with `persistStateKey`,
 * to make the `RequestList` store the initial sources to the default key-value store and load them after restart,
 * which will prevent any issues that a live list of URLs might cause.
 *
 * **Basic usage:**
 * ```javascript
 * const requestList = await RequestList.open('my-request-list', [
 *     'http://www.example.com/page-1',
 *     { url: 'http://www.example.com/page-2', method: 'POST', userData: { foo: 'bar' }},
 *     { requestsFromUrl: 'http://www.example.com/my-url-list.txt', userData: { isFromUrl: true } },
 * ]);
 * ```
 *
 * **Advanced usage:**
 * ```javascript
 * const requestList = await RequestList.open(null, [
 *     // Separate requests
 *     { url: 'http://www.example.com/page-1', method: 'GET', headers: { ... } },
 *     { url: 'http://www.example.com/page-2', userData: { foo: 'bar' }},
 *
 *     // Bulk load of URLs from file `http://www.example.com/my-url-list.txt`
 *     // Note that all URLs must start with http:// or https://
 *     { requestsFromUrl: 'http://www.example.com/my-url-list.txt', userData: { isFromUrl: true } },
 * ], {
 *     // Persist the state to avoid re-crawling which can lead to data duplications.
 *     // Keep in mind that the sources have to be immutable or this will throw an error.
 *     persistStateKey: 'my-state',

     * Opens a request list and returns a promise resolving to an instance

     *
     * {@apilink RequestList} represents a list of URLs to crawl, which is always stored in memory.
     * To enable picking up where left off after a process restart, the request list sources
     * are persisted to the key-value store at initialization of the list. Then, while crawling,
     * a small state object is regularly persisted to keep track of the crawling status.
     *
     * For more details and code examples, see the {@apilink RequestList} class.
     *
     * **Example usage:**
     *
     * ```javascript
     * const sources = [
     *     'https://www.example.com',
     *     'https://www.google.com',
     *     'https://www.bing.com'
     * ];
     *
     * const requestList = await RequestList.open('my-name', sources);
     * ```
     *
     * @param listNameOrOptions
     *   Name of the request list to be opened, or the options object. Setting a name enables the `RequestList`'s
     *   state to be persisted in the key-value store. This is useful in case of a restart or migration. Since `RequestList`
     *   is only stored in memory, a restart or migration wipes it clean. Setting a name will enable the `RequestList`'s
     *   state to survive those situations and continue where it left off.
     *
     *   The name will be used as a prefix in key-value store, producing keys such as `NAME-REQUEST_LIST_STATE`
     *   and `NAME-REQUEST_LIST_SOURCES`.
     *
     *   If `null`, the list will not be persisted and will only be stored in memory. Process restart
     *   will then cause the list to be crawled again from the beginning. We suggest always using a name.
     * @param [sources]
     *  An array of sources of URLs for the {@apilink RequestList}. It can be either an array of strings,
     *  plain objects that define at least the `url` property, or an array of {@apilink Request} instances.
     *
     *  **IMPORTANT:** The `sources` array will be consumed (left empty) after {@apilink RequestList} initializes.
     *  This is a measure to prevent memory leaks in situations when millions of sources are
     *  added.
     *
     *  Additionally, the `requestsFromUrl` property may be used instead of `url`,
     *  which will instruct {@apilink RequestList} to download the source URLs from a given remote location.
     *  The URLs will be parsed from the received response. In this case you can limit the URLs
     *  using `regex` parameter containing regular expression pattern for URLs to be included.
     *
     *  For details, see the {@apilink RequestListOptions.sources}
     * @param [options]
     *   The {@apilink RequestList} options. Note that the `listName` parameter supersedes
     *   the {@apilink RequestListOptions.persistStateKey} and {@apilink RequestListOptions.persistRequestsKey}
     *   options and the `sources` parameter supersedes the {@apilink RequestListOptions.sources} option.
