import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import AcceptInputSource from '!!raw-loader!./accept_user_input.ts';

This example accepts and logs user input:

<CodeBlock className="language-js">
	{AcceptInputSource}
</CodeBlock>

To provide the actor with input, create a `INPUT.json` file inside the "default" key-value store:

```bash
{PROJECT_FOLDER}/storage/key_value_stores/default/INPUT.json
```

Anything in this file will be available to the actor when it runs.

To learn about other ways to provide an actor with input, refer to the [Apify Platform Documentation](https://apify.com/docs/actor#run).
