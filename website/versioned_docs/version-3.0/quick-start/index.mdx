With this short tutorial you can start scraping with Crawlee in a minute or two. To learn in-depth how Crawlee works, read the [Introduction](./introduction), which is a comprehensive step-by-step guide for creating your first scraper.

## Choose your crawler

Crawlee comes with three main crawler classes: <ApiLink to="cheerio-crawler/class/CheerioCrawler">`CheerioCrawler`</ApiLink>, <ApiLink to="puppeteer-crawler/class/PuppeteerCrawler">`PuppeteerCrawler`</ApiLink> and <ApiLink to="playwright-crawler/class/PlaywrightCrawler">`PlaywrightCrawler`</ApiLink>. All classes share the same interface for maximum flexibility when switching between them.

### CheerioCrawler
This is a plain HTTP crawler. It parses HTML using the [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio) library and crawls the web using the specialized [got-scraping](https://github.com/apify/got-scraping) HTTP client which masks as a browser. It's very fast and efficient, but can't handle JavaScript rendering.

### PuppeteerCrawler
This crawler uses a headless browser to crawl, controlled by the [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) library. It can control Chromium or Chrome. Puppeteer is the de-facto standard in headless browser automation.

### PlaywrightCrawler
[Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) is a more powerful and full-featured successor to Puppeteer. It can control Chromium, Chrome, Firefox, Webkit and many other browsers. If you're not familiar with Puppeteer already, and you need a headless browser, go with Playwright.

:::caution before you start

Crawlee requires [Node.js 16 or later](https://nodejs.org/en/).

:::

## Installation with Crawlee CLI

The fastest way to try Crawlee out is to use the **Crawlee CLI** and choose the **Getting started example**.
The CLI will install all the necessary dependencies and add boilerplate code for you to play with.

```bash
npx crawlee create my-crawler
```

After the installation is complete you can start the crawler like this:

```bash
cd my-crawler && npm start
```

## Manual installation

You can add Crawlee to any Node.js project by running:

<Tabs groupId="quick_start">
<TabItem value="cheerio" label="CheerioCrawler" default>
<CodeBlock language="bash">npm install crawlee</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="playwright" label="PlaywrightCrawler">

:::caution

`playwright` is not bundled with Crawlee to reduce install size and allow greater flexibility. You need to explicitly install it with NPM. 👇

:::

<CodeBlock language="bash">npm install crawlee playwright</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="puppeteer" label="PuppeteerCrawler">

:::caution

`puppeteer` is not bundled with Crawlee to reduce install size and allow greater flexibility. You need to explicitly install it with NPM. 👇

:::

<CodeBlock language="bash">npm install crawlee puppeteer</CodeBlock>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Crawling

Run the following example to perform a recursive crawl of the Crawlee website using the selected crawler.

<Admonition type="caution" title="Don't forget about module imports">
    To run the example, add a <code>"type": "module"</code> clause into your <code>package.json</code> or
    copy it into a file with an <code>.mjs</code> suffix. This enables <code>import</code> statements in Node.js.
    See <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/docs/api/esm.html#enabling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Node.js docs</a> for
    more information.
</Admonition>

<Tabs groupId="quick_start">
    <TabItem value="cheerio" label="CheerioCrawler" default>
        <CodeBlock language="js">{CheerioSource}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="playwright" label="PlaywrightCrawler">
        <CodeBlock language="js">{PlaywrightSource}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="puppeteer" label="PuppeteerCrawler">
        <CodeBlock language="js">{PuppeteerSource}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you run the example, you will see Crawlee automating the data extraction process in your terminal.

<CodeBlock language="log">{CheerioLog}</CodeBlock>


### Running headful browsers

Browsers controlled by Puppeteer and Playwright run headless (without a visible window). You can switch to headful by adding the `headless: false` option to the crawlers' constructor. This is useful in the development phase when you want to see what's going on in the browser.

<Tabs groupId="quick_start">
    <TabItem value="playwright" label="PlaywrightCrawler">
        <CodeBlock language="js">{PlaywrightHeadful}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="puppeteer" label="PuppeteerCrawler">
        <CodeBlock language="js">{PuppeteerHeadful}</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

When you run the example code, you'll see an automated browser blaze through the Crawlee website.

## Results

Crawlee stores data to the `./storage` directory in your current working directory. The results of your crawl will be available under `./storage/datasets/default/*.json` as JSON files.

```json title="./storage/datasets/default/000000001.json"
{
    "url": "https://crawlee.dev/",
    "title": "Crawlee · The scalable web crawling, scraping and automation library for JavaScript/Node.js | Crawlee"
}
```

:::tip

You can override the storage directory by setting the `CRAWLEE_STORAGE_DIR` environment variable.
